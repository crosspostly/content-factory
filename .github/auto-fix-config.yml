# Auto-Fix Agent Configuration
# This agent is ALWAYS ENABLED and creates Pull Requests with fixes
# You manually review and merge the PRs

auto_fix:
  # ALWAYS ENABLED - Creates PR on every failure
  # Workflow is triggered automatically on workflow failures
  # No need to change anything here!
  enabled: true

  # Enable/disable GitHub issue creation
  # true = create issue with analysis + create PR with fix
  # false = only create issue, no PR
  create_issue: true

  # Gemini model - using fastest 2.5 Flash
  # Options: gemini-2.5-flash (fast), gemini-2.0-pro (smarter)
  model: gemini-2.5-flash

  # Minimum severity level to trigger auto-fix
  # Options: critical, high, medium, low
  min_severity: low  # Fix all failures

workflow:
  # Which workflows trigger auto-fix
  triggers:
    - "Generate Content (Part 1 MVP)"
    - "test"

logging:
  # Save analysis to artifacts for debugging
  save_analysis: true
  verbose: false

# How it works:
# 1. Workflow fails
# 2. Auto-Fix Agent automatically starts
# 3. Gemini 2.5 analyzes the error
# 4. Creates GitHub Issue with detailed analysis
# 5. If auto-fix possible: Creates PR with code changes
# 6. You review PR and manually merge
#
# This is the SAFE approach - you're always in control!
