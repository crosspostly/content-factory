1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The year is 1587. A small band of English
colonists, led by Governor John White,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
lands on Roanoke Island. Among them, his
daughter, Eleanor Dare, pregnant. She

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
gives birth to Virginia Dare, the first
English child born in the New World.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Governor White returns to England for
supplies. The Anglo-Spanish War delays his

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
return for three long years. What he finds
upon his return sends a chill through

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
history: the colony is gone. Vanished. No
trace, save for 'CROATOAN' carved into a

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
post. The fate of the Lost Colony of
Roanoke, an enduring enigma, has haunted

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
historians for centuries. A historical
vacuum.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, for centuries, just theories 
assimilation, massacre, starvation  but no

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
definitive proof. Just that single,
cryptic clue.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Precisely. Until 1937. Louis Hammond, a
tourist from Georgia, exploring swamps

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
near Edenton, North Carolina. Hes looking
for old Indian campsites, but stumbles

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
upon a weathered quartz stone, eighteen by
fourteen inches, bearing an inscription

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that would shatter four centuries of
silence.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Are you saying this stone, found in 1937,
claimed to be from Eleanor Dare herself,

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
miles from Roanoke? Thats an extraordinary
claim.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It is. And the inscription was even more
extraordinary. It read, in part: 'ANANIAS

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
DARE & VIRGINIA WENT HENCE UNTO HEAVEN
1591. MANY ENGLISH SLAYN ALL SAVE

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
SEVENTEEN. MISTRESS ELANOR DARE AND
MARGARET HARVIE.' It spoke of death,

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
massacre, and a desperate struggle. It
identified the location as 'ROANOKE' and

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
mentioned 'GOVERNOR WHITE, MY FATHER,'
pleading for him to 'COME.' A message from

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the grave, from Eleanor Dare, detailing
the horrific fate of her husband, her

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
child, and many colonists, four years
after Governor Whites departure.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But how do we explain a stone appearing
centuries later, with such a precise,

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
heartbreaking message, detailing events no
one else witnessed? The improbability is

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
staggering.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The improbability was certainly noted.
Hammond, with little formal education,

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
brought the stone to Dr. Haywood Pearce
Jr., Vice President of Emory University.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Pearce, a historian, was captivated. He
examined the stone, the archaic spelling,

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the style of the carving. He consulted
with geologists and linguists. Initial

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
skepticism gave way as the stone, with its
deep weathering and seemingly authentic

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
script, began to sway him.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So, a respected academic, a historian,
vouched for this stone, despite its

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
incredible claims and convenient
discovery? A significant endorsement.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It was. Dr. Pearce became convinced of its
authenticity. The news exploded. Imagine,

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
after all those centuries, a voice from
the Lost Colony. The public was

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
enthralled. The media called it one of the
greatest archaeological finds in American

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
history. It offered not just a clue, but a
detailed, first-person account. It filled

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the void. And then, the story deepened
further.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Just months later, more stones began to
surface. Not just one, but a steady

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
stream. Hammond himself found a second,
then a third. Others, inspired by

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
publicity, began 'discovering' their own.
Each stone picked up the narrative,

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
creating a macabre trail across the
Carolina wilderness, extending into

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Georgia. The story they told was
harrowing.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But how do we explain the sheer number of
these stones, each contributing to a

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
continuous narrative? This isn't just one
anomaly; it's a saga unfolding through

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
stone, often found by different
individuals. That seems less like

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
archaeology and more like a carefully
constructed chronicle.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Indeed. The total number eventually
climbed to forty-eight. Each stone,

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
purportedly from Eleanor Dare, detailed
her desperate journey south with the

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
remaining survivors. They spoke of further
attacks, the deaths of more colonists,

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
constant fear, dwindling numbers. One,
from Stone Mountain, Georgia, spoke of a

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
final, tragic fate for the last survivors,
including Eleanor herself, betrayed and

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
enslaved by a 'savage King.' The final
stones depicted her own death, alone, in

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
1599.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So, a complete, albeit tragic, narrative
arc. From initial massacre to Eleanors

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
solitary death, all carved into these
stones. But the scope, the consistency,

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the sheer convenience of each piece
fitting perfectly it strains credulity.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The Lost Colony mystery isn't just solved;
it's practically a novel written in stone.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Your skepticism is entirely warranted. The
academic community, while initially

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
intrigued, soon found itself deeply
divided. On one side, those who saw

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
compelling evidence: archaic language,
detailed historical references, the

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
weathering. On the other, a growing chorus
pointing to the increasing number, their

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
geographical spread, and the almost
too-perfect narrative as glaring red

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
flags. The very completeness became its
undoing for many.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We must consider the context. America was
grappling with its foundational myths. The

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
idea of a direct, tragic message from the
earliest English settlers, from the mother

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
of the first English child, was incredibly
powerful. It spoke to a deep-seated desire

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
to connect with that lost past, to finally
understand what became of those brave,

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
doomed pioneers. It offered closure, a
narrative that captivated a nation. But

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
closure, especially when it arrives so
perfectly packaged, often demands a closer

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
look.

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The Dare Stones, for a time, were accepted
as genuine. But as the volume and

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
narrative coherence grew, so did the
whispers of doubt. Were these stones truly

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Eleanor Dare's final, desperate cries? Or
were they something far more modern, a

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
masterful deception crafted to exploit a
nation's longing for answers? The stage

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
was set for one of America's greatest
historical controversies.
