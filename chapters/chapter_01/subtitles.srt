00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
From the desolate Iron Peak, whispers of
an unseen hammer have echoed for

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
centuries. Tales of ancient power,
striking without a wielder. Could these be

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
more than legend?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Wait, are you saying there's actual
historical record of an invisible hammer,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
or just folklore? We need to differentiate
myth from documented events.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The records show consistent accounts
across disparate cultures, describing

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
rhythmic percussive sounds emanating from
the Peak, often preceding significant

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
seismic activity. Not just folklore.
