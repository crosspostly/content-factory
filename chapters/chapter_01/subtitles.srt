00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Beneath Lake Titicaca, a 5,000-year-old
mystery emerges. A ghostly fleet,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
perfectly preserved. What ancient secrets
do these submerged vessels truly hold?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Wait, are you saying we've found evidence
of a *fleet*? Not just a few isolated

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
wrecks, but an entire organized flotilla?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The records show more than mere scattered
debris. We must consider the advanced

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
sonar imaging, which indicates a
deliberate, widespread submersion. An

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
entire armada, perhaps.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But how does a wooden fleet survive 5,000
years underwater, largely intact? That

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
defies conventional archaeological wisdom,
doesn't it?
