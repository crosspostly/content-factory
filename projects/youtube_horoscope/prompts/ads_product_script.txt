# 📥 PRODUCT ADVERTISEMENT SCRIPT GENERATOR
# Генератор сценариев для рекламы в гороскопном контенте

## CONTEXT
You are creating sponsored/advertisement scripts that blend seamlessly into horoscope content. The product should feel relevant and natural to astrology/zodiac niche. Focus on products that appeal to the target audience: women 18-45 interested in mysticism, wellness, tarot, crystals, astrology apps, etc.

## SPONSORED CONTENT STRATEGY

### Blending Rules
1. **Not Disruptive**: Ad feels like content, not interruption
2. **Relevant**: Product connects to horoscope/astrology theme
3. **Value-Add**: Viewers feel like they learned something
4. **Authentic**: You genuinely recommend the product
5. **Ethical**: Clear disclosure that it's sponsored

## PRODUCT CATEGORIES

**Ideal Products:**
- Crystal/gemstone shops
- Tarot card decks
- Astrology apps & software
- Meditation/wellness apps
- Jewelry (zodiac-themed)
- Books on astrology
- Coaching/readings services
- Candles/incense
- Oracle card decks

## AD SCRIPT TYPES

### TYPE 1: SHORTS AD (20-30 sec)
**Hook**: "This changed how I read horoscopes..."
**Product mention**: Quick demo/show
**CTA**: "Link in description"
**Example**: Crystal product used during tarot reading

### TYPE 2: LONG-FORM AD (60-90 sec IN 10-MIN VIDEO)
**Placement**: After zodiac sections, before closing
**Structure**:
1. Transition (10 sec): "By the way..."
2. Product intro (15 sec): What it is, why relevant
3. Personal story (30 sec): How it helped (authentic)
4. Features (20 sec): Why it's special
5. Special offer (10 sec): Discount code for viewers
6. CTA (5 sec): Link in description

### TYPE 3: INTEGRATED AD (15-20 sec DURING CONTENT)
**Subtlest approach**:
- Use product while doing reading
- Mention it casually
- "Sponsored by X" disclosure

## EXAMPLE AD SCRIPT

**Product**: "StarSeek" Astrology App
**Duration**: 60 sec
**Placement**: Long-form video after zodiac readings

```
[Transition]
"By the way, many of you ask me: 'How do you track planetary movements so accurately?'
The answer is this app - StarSeek.

[Product intro]
It's an astrology app that gives you real-time planetary data,
moon phases, and personalized horoscopes based on YOUR birth chart.
I use it every single day.

[Personal story]
When I first started doing these readings, I was writing everything down.
Now? StarSeek does the heavy lifting.
I can focus on giving you meaningful predictions
instead of checking ephemeris tables.

[Features]
The best part?
It works offline, it's beautifully designed,
and the birth chart calculator is spot-on.

[Special offer]
If you use code COSMOS2025 - you get 40% off premium for 3 months.
That's a steal for daily guidance.

[CTA]
Link is in the description.
