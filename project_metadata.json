New Evidence Breaks 400-Year Silence\n\nBRIEF & HOOKS:\nHOOK (10s Audio): A stone found in 1937 claims to reveal the horrifying end of Virginia Dare.\n\nCAPTION CONTENT (Deep Dive): The Dare Stone, discovered 350 years after Virginia Dare's birth, purports to be from her mother, Eleanor White Dare. It describes a massacre by 'savages' and the deaths of Virginia and her father, with survivors fleeing inland. While many Dare Stones were fakes, the first one's authenticity is still debated. It’s a chilling, violent account, a stark contrast to other theories, and adds a deeply unsettling layer to Roanoke's disappearance.\n\nGOAL: Drive traffic to \"The Dare Stones: Eleanor's Desperate Message or a Clever Hoax?\"\n\nGOAL:\nDrive traffic to main video\n----------------------------------------\nPlease follow these instructions strictly for the script structure.",
